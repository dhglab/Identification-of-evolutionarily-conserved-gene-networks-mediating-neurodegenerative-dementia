TPR50 Tau mouse consensus WGCNA Analysis (cortex) Swarup et al 2018

The repository has 3 folders - code, data and output. The R code to replicate the analyses are in the code folder. The input data in the form of csv files and RData files can be found under data/provided.

Additionally the processed gene expression data in the form of RData file is available for download in the releases section (https://github.com/dhglab/Identification-of-evolutionarily-conserved-gene-networks-mediating-neurodegenerative-dementia/releases). Please download the gene expression RData file and put in data/provided folder before running any code.
